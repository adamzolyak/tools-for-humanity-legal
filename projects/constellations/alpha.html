      <h1>Constellations App Alpha Testing</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! You've been invited to be an alpha tester for the Constellations App. You can learn more
        at <a href="https://constellationsapp.com/" target="_blank">constellationsapp.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been using the same principles and practices found in the Constellations App in my own
        personal journaling and wellness routine for the past few years. It's been so helpful to my
        own wellness that I wanted to share these tools with more people.
      </p>
      <h2>What's in it for me?</h2>
      <p>
        Alpha testers will be the first handful of people to use the Constellations App. It's a
        chance to shape the future of Constellations App, helping to make it useful so that it can
        positively impact many more people. While not guaranteed, your feedback could show up in a
        future version of the app!
      </p>
      <p>
        Alpha testers will also receive 1 free year of Constellations App (assuming it becomes
        generally available on the Apple App Store) for 1 year after it's launched.
      </p>
      <h2>What's involved?</h2>
      <p>
        Being an alpha tester includes downloading the Constellations App (iOS only right now -
        iPhone and iPad), using it, and providing feedback to a few questions (see below) via email
        or in real time (ex. Zoom). You can also optionally provide additional feedback on future
        updates or whenever you have feedback to share. Lastly, you may also be asked to provide
        feedback on future updates and ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alpha testers may encounter bugs and issues, and their data may be lost due to bugs or
        updates. Alpha testers agree to use Constellation App "as is" with no warranty or remedy due
        to bugs, issues, or other unforeseen consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can be removed as an alpha tester at any time by emailing
        feedback@constellationsapp.com.
      </p>
      <h2>I'm in! What do I do?</h2>
