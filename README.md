## Mission

To help people to be well and strong mentally, physically, and spiritually (philosophically) so that they can be whoever they want to be and serve others in doing the same!

## Vision

We believe many tools, processes, and systems are fundamentally inhumane; that is, they do not acknowledge and honor the fundamental wholeness and uniqueness of each person and do not support learning, growing, improving, and connecting with other people in healthy ways. Tools, processes, systems should be humane - fundamentally supporting the needs of people and seeking to integrate human needs with other efficiencies and outcomes.

We seek to create awareness of the current issues, shared vocabulary and mental models for understanding humane tools, processes, and systems, and creating tools that help people to have more humanity and to support the humanity of other people.

## Values

- We believe each person is unique. We seek to understand and honor the uniqueness of each person.
- We believe people are naturally creative, resourceful, and whole. We acknowledge this about each person, and seek to support each person from this point of view.
- We believe people have an innate need to learn, grow, and find fulfillment through doing and healthy struggle. We seek to support people in moving forward and struggling well along the way.
- We believe people have an innate need for connection with and to serve other people. We seek to support healthy connections and service between people.
- We believe all people have the right to humanity. Therefore, we offer our tools for free and rely on the benevolence of people to support this effort and community to support everyone having access to these tools.
