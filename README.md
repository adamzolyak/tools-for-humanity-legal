# Welcome to Tools for Humanity

## Mission

To help people to have the clarity, energy, and options they need to be live authentic fulfilling lives - having clarify of self, meaningful work, and meaningful community.

## Vision

We believe many tools, processes, and systems are fundamentally inhumane; that is, they do not acknowledge and honor the fundamental wholeness and uniqueness of each person and do not support learning, growing, improving, and connecting with other people in healthy ways. Tools, processes, systems should be humane - supporting the humanity of people and seeking to balance human needs with other efficiencies and goals.

We seek to create awareness of the current issues, a shared vocabulary and mental models for understanding humane tools / processes / systems, and tools that help people to have more humanity and to support the humanity of other people.

## Values

- We believe each person is unique. We seek to understand and honor the uniqueness of each person.
- We believe each person is naturally creative, resourceful, and whole. We seeks to acknowledge and support each person from this point of view.
- We believe each person has an innate need to learn, grow, and find purpose and fulfillment. We believe these often involve learning by doing and challenge along the way. We seek to support each person biasing to doing and in struggling well through challenge.
- We believe each person has an innate need for connection with and to serve other people. We seek to support healthy connections built on authenticity, appreciation, and service between people.
- We believe each and very person has the right to humanity. Therefore, we seek to offer our tools at a fair cost in order to benefit as many as people as possible while sustainably supporting the people involved in supporting Tools For Humanity.
